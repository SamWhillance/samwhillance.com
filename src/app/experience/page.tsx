            <H3>Overview</H3>
            Since 2017, Murray PHN has been completely transformed as a company and is now considered one of the leading PHNs in terms of technology and innovation.

            Initially contracted, became permanent. Job was to rebuild their CRM. I met with key staff to document processes & identify software requirements. I undertook evidence-based research to map business requirements with competing CRM platforms. The original CRM, which was primarily an account/contact metadata warehouse, was expanded into a broad, integrated Business Intelligence platform which manages data & assets in ways we didn't foresee, across many business areas such as governance, people & culture, finance, reporting, quality, risk, data and systems.

            <br />
            <br />

            <H3>I built these features into the CRM</H3>

            I developed in-house web applications, such as an internal 'staff hub' integrated into Dynamics 365 and the Microsoft Graph API.

            I built CRM integrated HTML5 software solutions, deployed on the Azure cloud environment with continuous deployment processes utilizing Git and Visual Studio Code. Some projects required their own web server (usually ExpressJS), which authenticated with the Microsoft Dynamics and Graph APIs.

            The ways in which the PHN automates its processes evolved over time, as did the technology that empowered the company. Power Automate (Microsoft Flow) is integrated into many of the company's systems. These automated processes include actionable reminders, data transformation, and file/data intake.

            I migrated another Primary Health Network from ChilliDB to a custom Dynamics 365 solution we had built in-house. This includes ongoing support and customization of their CRM solution.

            My other responsibilities included training, Office 365 administration, and support.

                During the two years at CA Technologies, our team built a bottom-up web interface to allow new and existing customers to manage their complex CA Directory instances in a user-friendly way. All configuration was previously done through a command line interface. The new web interface included forms and inputs that were dynamically generated from schema files, physics-enabled network diagrams which visualized connections between hardware, and their status, and a fully automated testing suite integrated into the deployment process.</p>
